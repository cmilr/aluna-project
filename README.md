# DarkRoom

DarkRoom is a take-home project I recently completed as part of the interview process for an iOS Developer role. The basic requirements for the app were that it display ten currently showing movies and ten upcoming movies, using data from [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/)'s REST api. Choice of design and UI elements were left open to the developer.

I'm quite happy with the final productâ€”it was built entirely in Swift, no external dependencies were used, the UI is attractive, animates smoothly, and is easy to navigate, and perhaps most importantly, the code is clean and easy to read.
